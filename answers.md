1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

   describe() is used to group a collection of it()/tests() together. describe('GET endpoint', {...}) for example could contain all the it/tests that test the get endpoint.

1. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

   the point of test driven development is to simultaneously build the tests and project together. you will create the first test, then implement the functionality in the project to pass the test. this allows us refactor and make changes to the code and have an easy way of knowing what did or did not change in the functionality.

1. Mention three types of automated tests.
   unit, integration, and end-to-end.
